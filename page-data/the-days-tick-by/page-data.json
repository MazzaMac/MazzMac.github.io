As usual, I feel like I haven’t done that much this week, but when I look back through my notes I realise I’ve actually read quite a lot so that’s good!</p>\n<p>One of my resolutions this year (yeah, I know I wasn’t going to tell you,\nbutIMG_0300 it’s relevant now) was to date the pages of my notebook and write down literally any “interesting” thought I might have throughout the day. A sort of pseudo diary, I suppose, because I’m not really recording events as such, just images and musings. So yes, I’m using “pseudo” to mean both “sham” and “pretentious” here…hmm, well done me? Not a particularly novel idea, but I’m finding it quite helpful; I’m certainly getting plenty of creative writing done now anyhow. I’m also toeing the water in terms of research too. Currently reading Daston &#x26; Mitman’s <em>Thinking With Animals</em>, which is pretty darn relevant/interesting thus far.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 482px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0d321e1645644896ac7b3645e1395cae/05b37/thinking-with-animals.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 87.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"thinking with animals\"\n        title=\"thinking with animals\"\n        src=\"/static/0d321e1645644896ac7b3645e1395cae/05b37/thinking-with-animals.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0d321e1645644896ac7b3645e1395cae/e07e9/thinking-with-animals.jpg 200w,\n/static/0d321e1645644896ac7b3645e1395cae/066f9/thinking-with-animals.jpg 400w,\n/static/0d321e1645644896ac7b3645e1395cae/05b37/thinking-with-animals.jpg 482w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Just got back from the library, which was, as always, oven-like in its ability to cook me slowly from the inside out. I picked up the complete works of Shelley, Dickinson and Rossetti. Not my usual bag, but I spoke to my supervisor last week who suggested choosing three poets and ONLY READING THEM FOR A WHOLE MONTH. Initially a year was suggested and we was like whaaaaaat?! But we agreed that that’s an inordinate amount of time to only read three poets, particularly when I have a thesis to write about three entirely different poets. It was also suggested that I might like to read some more “traditional” works, since I’m a postmodern, free verse kinda gal and find the very idea of rhyme and metre utterly nauseating. That’s not necessarily to say I don’t like it when other people do it, I just cannot bear it when I try to do it myself.</p>\n<p>So these are the three I pick because…you know, I heard they’re quite good. Right now I find the idea of this task utterly arduous, so I’m throwing in John Ashbery as well otherwise I think I’ll go mad. I’m also listening to James Schuyler’s <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/21778\">Hymn to Life</a> LOADS because it’s bloody great and ain’t nobody gon’ stop me!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 448px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/72768cac8c00881fff41f34f5b4c38aa/fb05c/me-and-john-ashbery.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Me and John Ashbery\"\n        title=\"Me and John Ashbery\"\n        src=\"/static/72768cac8c00881fff41f34f5b4c38aa/fb05c/me-and-john-ashbery.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/72768cac8c00881fff41f34f5b4c38aa/e07e9/me-and-john-ashbery.jpg 200w,\n/static/72768cac8c00881fff41f34f5b4c38aa/066f9/me-and-john-ashbery.jpg 400w,\n/static/72768cac8c00881fff41f34f5b4c38aa/fb05c/me-and-john-ashbery.jpg 448w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I’ll keep you posted on how long I last with this. (NB, yeah, I know I probably should have read all of these poets in more detail than I have thus far, but I planted my roots in linguistics, not literature, so gimme a GD break, would ya?)</p>\n<p>Burns Nicht today, obvi, so off for some haggis and poetry reading with pals this evening. This time last year I was taking part in the <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/poetry-grand-slam-tickets-19947187575\">NLS Burns Night Slam</a> which is worth popping along to if you’re in Edinburgh and at a loose end – lots of great performers taking part in a welcoming environment. I’m sad I’m not doing it again!</p>\n<p>Right, back to the grind. JK I’m gonna eat a piece of toast first, and then get back to it. Here’s a rundown of the rest of my week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poetry –</strong> two poems finished, one of which needs major work, the other…is okay for now.</li>\n<li><strong>PhD –</strong> See above, I guess.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise –</strong> 25 lengths at the pool and an earful of water, which is making me feel a bit sickish tbh.</li>\n<li><strong>Drawings –</strong> Pretty much forgot that this was one of the things I was doing…I’ll pick that back up at some point soon, I’m sure.</li>\n<li><strong>Comedy –</strong> We recorded a podcast yesterday! <em>It Disney Matter (It Does)</em> is officially baaaaack! I’ll get a link up at some point, because I know you’re all dying to listen.</li>\n<li><strong>Puppy –</strong> Got bathed this weekend, looking extremely dapper! Wasn’t going to post a picture of him this week, but he’s just too cute, so I’m sharing:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/06235709847cf2b06cb1c5516b62fc26/7bf67/chummy-hair-day.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 103%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"chumbo\"\n        title=\"chumbo\"\n        src=\"/static/06235709847cf2b06cb1c5516b62fc26/7bf67/chummy-hair-day.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/06235709847cf2b06cb1c5516b62fc26/e07e9/chummy-hair-day.jpg 200w,\n/static/06235709847cf2b06cb1c5516b62fc26/066f9/chummy-hair-day.jpg 400w,\n/static/06235709847cf2b06cb1c5516b62fc26/7bf67/chummy-hair-day.jpg 680w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>See you next week, dolls.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Days Tick By"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-days-tick-by/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
